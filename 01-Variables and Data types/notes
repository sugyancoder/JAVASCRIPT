Variable rules
Variable names are case sensitive; "a" & "A" is diffrent.
Only letters, digits, underscore(_) and $ is allowed.(not even space)
Only a letter, underscore(_) or $ should be 1st character.
Reserved wirds cannot be variable names.

let,const & var
var: Variable can be re-declared & updated. A global scope variable.
let: Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope variable.
const: Variable cannot be re-declared or updated. A block scope variable.

Es6 came out on 2015 and let and const were declared back then before that 
everyone used to use var instead of let or const.
var can cause errors and many problems so we should never use var.
const cant be redeclared or updated.
